Microsoft Azure Support assistance is limited to managed portals and only the initial setup of self-hosted portals ([documented in the Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal/wiki/Self-hosting-the-portal)); best effort support is provided for problems that are caused by environmental factors, such as (but not limited to): hosting platform, development environment, network configuration. Other self-hosted portal assistance requests (for example, problem with custom widgets) should be submitted [on Stack Overflow](https://aka.ms/apimso) with the `azure-api-management` tag. **We don't provide support through GitHub Issues**.

We welcome and appreciate **[community contributions](CONTRIBUTIONS.md)**. Refer to the **[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal/wiki/Widget-contribution-guidelines)** for more information.
