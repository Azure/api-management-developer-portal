## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

The new developer portal is based on our own fork of the [Paperbits framework](http://paperbits.io/) - a [JAMstack technology](https://jamstack.org/), which we extended to provide API Management-specific features.

You can deploy and self-host it outside of an API Management instance. This approach allows you to edit the portal's codebase and extend the provided core functionality. For  instructions, please refer to [documentation in the repository's Wiki section](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal/wiki).
