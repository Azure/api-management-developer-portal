# API Management developer portal - private preview

## Overview

The API Management developer portal is based on our own fork of the [Paperbits framework](http://paperbits.io/). It has a modern default look and feel, and is optimized for:

- Customization, styling, and authoring through a visual editor.
- Programmatic access through APIs for automating the development, management, and deployment.
- Extensibility of the core functionality.

We extended the original Paperbits functionality to provide API Management-specific widgets (e.g., a list of APIs, or Products). We also implemented a connector to an API Management instance for saving and retrieving the content (e.g., pages, configuration, styling).

The code of the developer portal is available in [our Github repository](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal). We will maintain it and ensure it includes the latest updates from 3rd party dependencies, including the original Paperbits project. We will also keep adding more API Management-specific features.

If you wish to have the best experience with your developer portal, you should **always merge updates from our original repository to your fork**.

When we reach the public preview stage, the repository will become publicly available.
