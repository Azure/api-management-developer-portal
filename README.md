## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

The developer portal is based on our own fork of the [Paperbits framework](http://paperbits.io/) - a [JAMstack technology](https://jamstack.org/), which we enriched with API Management-specific features.

You can deploy and self-host the portal outside of an API Management service. This approach allows you to extend the portal's core functionality and control its deployments. For  instructions, refer to the [documentation in the Wiki section](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal/wiki).
